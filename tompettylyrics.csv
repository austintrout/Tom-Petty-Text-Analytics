1989,Tom Petty,A Face in the Crowd,"Before all of this ever went down
In another place, another town
You were just a face in the crowd
You were just a face in the crowd
Out in the street walking around
A face in the crowd
Out of a dream, out of the sky
Into my heart, into my life
And you were just a face in the crowd
You were just a face in the crowd
Out in the street, thinking out loud
A face in the crowd
Out of a dream, out of the sky
Into my heart, into my life
And you were just a face in the crowd
You were just a face in the crowd
Out in the street, walking around
A face in the crowd
Face in the crowd
A face in the crowd
A face in the crowd",Full Moon Fever ,

May God watch over you from above
Tomorrow I'm workin' what would I do

So close your eyes

I've spent my life travelin'
Spent my life free

She said she cared about me
She tried to make my world
The way she thought it should be

Yeah, we were desperate then
To have each other to hold
But love is a long, long road
Yeah, love is a long, long road

There were so many times
I would wake up at noon
Yeah, with my head spinning 'round
I would wait for the moon

And give her one more chance
To try and save my soul
But love is a long, long road
Yeah, love is a long, long road

Yeah, it was hard to give up
Some things are hard to let go
Some things are never enough
I guess I only can hope
For maybe one more chance
To try and save my soul

It was always cold, no sunshine

That never would come to me
Workin' on a mystery, goin' wherever it leads
Runnin' down a dream

I rolled on, the sky grew dark

Underneath the paint you're just a little girl

Dancin' at the Zombie Zoo
Painted in a corner and all you wanna do
Is dance down at the Zombie Zoo

Is your mother in a clinic? Has your father got no job?
Sometimes you're so impulsive, you shaved off all your hair
You look like Boris Karloff and you don't even care

Dancin' at the Zombie Zoo
Painted in a corner and all you wanna do
Is dance down at the Zombie Zoo

I wonder where she goes until the night
Comes fallin' down again
You show up with your friends, half-alive
Dancin' at the Zombie Zoo,
Dancin' at the Zombie Zoo
Well, you can make a big impression or go through life unseen
You might wind up restricted and over seventeen
It's so hard to be careful, so easy to be led
Somewhere beyond the pavement
You'll find the living dead.

Dancin' at the Zombie Zoo
Painted in a corner and all she wants to do
Is dance down at the Zombie Zoo

And we gotta leave by night
Before that river takes us down
We gotta find somewhere that's dry
We gotta run like we've never run
Or we're gonna lose the light
If we don't get to a higher place and find somebody
Can help somebody, might be nobody no more
Well, I fool myself and I don't know why
I thought we could ride this out
I was up all night making up my mind
But now I've got my doubts
I got my eye on the waterline
Trying to keep my sense of humor
But if we don't get to a higher place and find somebody
Can help somebody, might be nobody no more
We gotta get to a higher place
And I hope we all arrive together
We gotta get to a higher place
If we want to survive the weather
I remember walking with her in town
Her hair was in the wind
I gave her my best kiss
She gave it back again

You follow the leader into the trees

Time to open your eyes
And rise and shine
You spend your life dreaming, running 'round in a trance
You hang out forever and still miss the dance
And if you get lucky, you might find someone
To help you get over the pain that will come
Yeah, you were so cool back in high school, what happened?
You were so sure not to have your spirits dampened
But you're just a poor boy alone in this world
You're just a poor boy alone in this world
And it's wake up time
Time to open your eyes
And rise and shine
Well, if he gets lucky, a boy finds a girl
To help him to shoulder the pain in this world
And if you follow your feelings
And you follow your dreams
You might find the forest there in the trees
Yeah, you'll be alright, it's just gonna take time, but now
Who could have seen you'd be so hard to please somehow
You're just a poor boy a long way from home

What lies ahead, I have no way of knowing
But under my feet, baby, grass is growing
It's time to move on, it's time to get going
Broken skyline, movin' through the airport
She's an honest defector
Conscientious objector
Now her own protector
Broken skyline, which way to love land
Which way to something better
Which way to forgiveness
Which way do I go
It's time to move on, time to get going
What lies ahead, I have no way of knowing
But under my feet, baby, grass is growing
It's time to move on, it's time to get going

Wasting the meaning and losing the rhyme
Nauseous adrenalin
Like breakin' up a dogfight
Like a deer in the headlights
Frozen in real time

What lies ahead, I have no way of knowing

Fighting sleep with windows down
Worn out from long goodbyes
Night driver
Drifting home again
You offered up no history
When you blew into town
You remain a mystery
No information found
I speed dial a judgment call
A near miss hits the ground
The new king hides behind the throne
Refusing to be crowned

Drifting home again
High tide rumbles PCH
My tires losing tread
Helicopter circling
White beam overhead

Boy, it was sad
But he bought a new car
Found a new bar
And went under another name
Created a whole new game
And the days went by like paper in the wind
Everything changed, then changed again
It's hard to find a friend
It's hard to find a friend
Meanwhile then
His wife's boyfriend moved in and
Took over the house
Everybody was quiet as a mouse
And it changed their lives
Changed their plans
Slowly they grew apart
Boy, it woulda broke your heart
And the days went by like paper in the wind
Everything changed, then changed again
It's hard to find a friend
It's hard to find a friend",Highway Companion,

2006,Tom Petty,Flirting with Time,"A coyote ran across the road
On the move without a home
A flash of light reminded me of you
This could well be your last stand
Hold the sunlight in your hand
Spread your fingers
Feel the sand fall through
I've done all I can do, now it's up to you...
You're flirting with time baby
Flirting with time, and maybe
Time, baby, is catching up with you
Shadow men talk a real good game
Every punch line has your name
You cried out and no one came to you
I've done all I can do, now it's up to you...
You're flirting with time baby
Flirting with time, and maybe
Time, baby, is catching up with you
Should be more to learn from this
Can't say I know what it is
No difference 'tween a hit or miss, it's true
I've done all I can do, now it's up to you...
You're flirting with time baby
Flirting with time, and maybe
Time, baby, is catching up with you",Highway Companion,
2006,Tom Petty,Down South,"Headed back down south
Gonna see my daddy's mistress
Gonna buy back her forgiveness
Pay off every witness
One more time down south
Sell the family headstones
Drag a bag of dry bones
Make good on my back loans
So if I come to your door
Let me sleep on your floor
I'll give you all I have
And a little more
Sleep late down south
Look up my former mentors
Live off Yankee winters
Be a landlord and a renter
Create myself down south
Impress all the women
Pretend I'm Samuel Clemens
Wear seersucker and white linens
So if I come to your door
Let me sleep on your floor
I'll give you all I have
And a little more
Spanish moss down south
Find the heroes of my childhood
Who now can do me no good
Carve their names in dogwood
Chase a ghost down south
Spirits cross the dead fields
Mosquitoes hit the windshield
All documents remain sealed
So if I come to your door
Let me sleep on your floor
I'll give you all I have
And a little more
I'll give you all I have
And a little more",Highway Companion,
2006,Tom Petty,Jack,"You say what you want to Jack
I'm gonna get my baby back
Trouble came ran away
Now you say she's gone to stay
Got fed up, hit the street
Left without a word to me
Oh you don't know
How the girl could touch my soul
You say what you want to Jack
I'm gonna get my baby back
Suddenly you know my name
Say there's only me to blame
It's gonna rain, it's gonna shine
Gotta stay between the lines
Rolling down a lonely road
You say I should let it go
Wish you would come on down
If you need I'll come around
You say what you want to Jack
I'm gonna get my baby back
Used to have a son named Joe
Where he got to I don't know
Maybe down in Mexico
Livin' off her daddy's dough
If you give me half a chance
I will make her sing and dance
I'm gonna give her all my soul
I'm gonna play her rock and roll
You say what you want to Jack
I'm gonna get my baby back",Highway Companion,
2006,Tom Petty,Big Weekend,"There's some friends that I know
Living in this town
And I've come far to see them
Gonna track 'em down
They live in a brick house
Painted white and brown
Left a tip for the maid
And I packed up my guitar
Dropped my keys on the counter
Rented a car
Gonna hook up with 'em later
And go hit the bars
I need a big weekend
Kick up the dust
Yeah a big weekend
If you don't run you rust
Well I may shake your hand
But I won't know your name
The joke in your language
Don't come out the same
There's times when I'm down
And there's nothing to blame
I need a big weekend
Kick up the dust
Yeah a big weekend
If you don't run you rust
I can work
I can travel
Sleep anywhere
Cross every border
With nothing to declare
You can look back babe
But it's best not to stare
I need a big weekend
Kick up the dust
Yeah a big weekend
If you don't run you rust",Highway Companion,
2006,Tom Petty,This Old Town,"Living free
Is gaining on me
Can't keep ahead of my dreams
My relief turned out a thief
Smooth as rocks in the stream
This old town is a sad affair
You be glad you're not there
It ties your hands
It spikes your drink
I'd say more, but I can't think
Lazy Jim took a bottle with him
Tried to flag down a train
Left a note couldn't read what he wrote
A light came on in my brain
This old town is a sad affair
You be glad you're not there
It ties your hands
It spikes your drink
I'd say more, but I can't think
The hills are gold
Mornings are cold
Don't know a soul on the street
I keep to myself
Like everyone else
Nobody says much to me
Go to bed
Fight thoughts in my head
In the time between wake and sleep
Rats to kill
Contracts to fill
It's on ice but it won't keep
This old town is a sad affair
You be glad you're not there
It ties your hands
It spikes your drink
I'd say more, but I can't think",Highway Companion,
2006,Tom Petty,Ankle Deep,"Yeah they raised that horse to be a jumper
He was owned by a Midwest bible thumper
His preacher was a Louisiana drummer
Took all winter to get through the summer
The field hand hit the switch and stumbled
Outside the big engine roared and rumbled
The stolen horse spooked and tumbled
She didn't speak for a week, just kinda mumbled
Ankle deep
In love
Ankle deep
In love
He was caught up
In a lie he half believed
Found her hiding
High in the family tree
Washed his hands
And put her 'cross his knee
She said ""Daddy, you've been a mother to me""
Ankle deep
In love
Ankle deep
In love",Highway Companion,
2006,Tom Petty,The Golden Rose,"Well the golden rose sailed with a broken man goin' south
Got on board with a woman to lead him 'round by the mouth
And it's goodbye golden rose
Yeah it's goodbye golden rose
Well the captain who swears if he speaks it all, wears a gun
Got a first mate who's never quite on the ball for a son
And it's goodbye golden rose
Yeah it's goodbye golden rose
Wish I was back in her arms again
Wish I was holding her tight
Wish I was back in her arms again
Safe from the night
She stood on the shore and she waved to me, ""Come back home""
Many a night I would think of her all alone
And it's goodbye golden rose
Yeah it's goodbye golden rose",Highway Companion,
